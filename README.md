# arena_keeper

A simple HTML game build using Rust and Yew.

## Install
1. Follow the instalation instructions from [Yew](https://github.com/DenisKolodin/yew/tree/0.4.0).
2. Place a picture called human.png inside /static/assets/images
3. Do the same for a file called merfolk.png
## Run
Just like how you would run the examples from yew.
You use `cargo web start` to start a server and a watcher that will automatically compile your code on changes.
